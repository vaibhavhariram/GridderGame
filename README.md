Gridder is an educational, web-based geography game that helps players improve their spatial awareness by guessing or inputting latitude and longitude coordinates of major cities around the world. The game is designed for players to engage with geographical data and learn how coordinate systems work in a fun and interactive way.

Inspired by games like GeoGuessr and Wordle, Gridder provides daily challenges where players guess a city’s coordinates based on visual clues and hints, while also offering an alternative mode where users can input coordinate values to guess the city. This game is perfect for geography enthusiasts, students, and anyone looking to sharpen their knowledge of the world.

Features
Daily Griddle: A new geography puzzle every day, where players have 5 chances to guess a city’s coordinates.
Custom Challenges: Players can challenge themselves by inputting specific coordinates or city names.
Hints & Feedback: Like Wordle, players receive feedback on how close their guesses are, with hints based on distance and direction.
Tolerance Margin: The game uses a margin of error to make guessing more forgiving for users learning the coordinate system.
Top 5 Populous Cities by Continent: Players are provided a database of major cities by continent to assist with educated guesses.
Interactive Map: A Mercator projection map is displayed to keep the game visually consistent with web-based maps.
How to Play
The game will prompt players with either a set of coordinates or the name of a city.
Players will input their guesses in terms of either:
Latitude (0-90° N or S) and Longitude (0-180° E or W), or
The name of a city they think matches the given coordinates.
If the guess is incorrect, the game will provide feedback, showing how far off the guess was, and offering hints about direction.
Players can guess up to 5 times for each puzzle.
Each day, a new Griddle puzzle is available for a limited time.
Game Modes
Daily Griddle Mode: Guess the location of a city with 5 tries. Wordle-like hints help guide you towards the correct coordinates.
Free Play Mode: Test your geographic knowledge by entering cities or coordinates at any time without guess limits.
Technology Stack
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The front-end of the game is built using standard web technologies.
JavaScript Libraries: We use standard JavaScript for handling game logic, including input validation and providing feedback.
Mercator Projection: The game map is based on the Mercator projection to maintain visual consistency with typical online maps like Google Maps.
